## Developer setup

This project is built using plain React Native. So to run it locally, ensure you've set up your developer environment as described in the [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Then install the JavaScript dependencies:

```sh
yarn
# or
npm install
```

(iOS only) install the native dependencies:

```sh
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

Run the packager:

```sh
yarn start
```

Build the iOS app:

```sh
yarn ios
# or
npm run ios
```

Build the Android app:

```sh
yarn android
# or
npm run android
```
